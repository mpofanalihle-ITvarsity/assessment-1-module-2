                   <h3>LION</h3>
                   <p>Although the number of captive lions in South Africa has been estimated at between 6,000 and 8,000, there may now be as many as 10,000, according to conservationist Ian Michler, the protagonist of the 2015 documentary Blood Lions, which goes behind the scenes to examine the country's lion-farming industry.</p>
                   <p>It is estimated that in the wild, African and Asian lions live only 18-20 years. At the same time, in captivity lions can live up to 28-30 years. The oldest recorded lifespan of lion is reported to be 29 years.</p>
                     <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
