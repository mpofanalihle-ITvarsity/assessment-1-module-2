                <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                   <p>The Dusky leaf monkeys are known to live up to 25 years in captivity. There is no information on the life expectancy of this species in the wild, although it's believed to be less than that of captive individuals.</p>
                   <p>The diet of these monkeys consists of young leaves, shoots, and seedlings. They feed from 87 different species of trees, ingesting both leaves and fruit. In general, a dusky leaf monkey eats up to 2 kg of food per day.</p>
                   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
